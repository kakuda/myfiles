<div class="sample">

<div class="day">
<h2><a href="./?date=20010803">2001-08-03</a> <span class="title">title</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<h3 class="subtitle"><a name="p01" href="./?date=20010803#p01">_</a>sub-title(1)</h3>
<p> Like the above, the first line becomes a sub-title. With the tDiary's standard style sheet, the sub-title is displayed in bold face. Lines from the sub-title to the next space line are called section, and a section anchor is added in front of the sub-title. </p>
<p> Lines after the sub-title, like this line and the line just above, are recognized as normal lines. If a paragraph begins with a sub-title, a section anchor is not attached in front of normal lines.</p>
<p><a name="p02" href="./?date=20010803#p02">_</a> If a space line exists, the line means the separation of the sections. If space exists in front of the line like this line, the section doesn't have a sub-title. In addition, only the first paragraph has a section anchor. In this case, the line is not shown in bold face.</p>
<p> If a section doesn't begin with a sub-title, the second or later paragraphs don't have an anchor.</p>
<pre>
If the paragraph begins with a line whose first character is "&lt;", $
the whole section is not formatted. $
The lines from the beginning of the section to the next space line, 
in other words, to the next section, is shown as it is. $
This feature is convenient if you want to use 
HTML tags, for example, list or table. $
This section doesn't have a section anchor. $
</pre>
<h3 class="subtitle"><a name="p01" href="./?date=20010803#p04">_</a><a href="foobar">sub-title(2)</a></h3>
<p>As the result of it, you can't add a sub-title which begins with a HTML tag to a section. But if a line begins with "&lt;&lt;" like the line above, the line is also recognized as a sub-title.
