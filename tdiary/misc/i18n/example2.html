<div class="body">
<h3 class="subtitle"><a name="p01" href="./?date=20010830#p01">_</a>sub-title(1)</h3>
<p><a name="p02" href="./?date=20010830#p02">_</a>Like this, you put a space line under the sub-title and make a section to begin with space. This makes two sections. The first section has only the sub-title. The second section has only the paragraph.</p>
<p><a name="p03" href="./?date=20010830#p03">_</a>If you insert a space line to every paragraph, every paragraph has an anchor.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle"><a name="p04" href="./?date=20010830#p04">_</a>sub-title(2)</h3>
<p><a name="p04" href="./?date=20010830#p04">_</a>Please be careful that a line which doesn't begin with space becomes a sub-title.</p>
